Game/Form Project -Update with more appropriate title

ReadMe for Java Script Project that could be a game and a mixture of a form with different funtionality


The General ideal I have for this and we can ofcourse change if need to is to have a page that depending on what we want to do displays the appropriate items that lets us complete the function we choose. For example:

* We have a word "*Modern*"  - one of the funtions we want to build may be to Switch or place the vowels(or constenats) around and place them in eachothers spot. So "Modern" would become "Medorn" and so forth.
-We may want to take into consideration edgecases like case sensitivity or even the addition of numbers.

This is just one example of a function of many. But the gist is to be able to select what ever we name the funtion and have the page/form adapt to what ever input we need and for the input to be displayed.

Now to Gamify this - We need to think about it a little more!
